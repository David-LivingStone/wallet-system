# Wallet System

Design the database for an application in which users can have multiple wallets with each wallet type having its own name, minimum balance and monthly interest rate. The wallets should be able to send and receive money from other wallets.

Create endpoints that perform the following actions:
- Get all users in the system.
- Get all wallets in the system.
- Get a wallet's details including its owner, type and available balance.
- Send money from one wallet to another.
